# Hiroto's Rock Paper Scissors game project
This project was used for the completion of Foundations part of The Odin Project's Javascript curriculum. I learned so many about javascript when creating this project.

Initially, I was going with the console-only gameplay as intended in the project requirements. But then I saw many of other students work involves HTML DOM Manipulation and few _"advanced" (imo)_ javascript. So I gave it a try and now it works.

From this project, I learned more about Function, Callbacks, HTML and CSS DOM manipulation, and many more that I forgot the name but I remembered learning it.
